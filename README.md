To create a new room, use `Room(room_id, name, description, north_exit=None, south_exit=None, east_exit=None, west_exit=None, up_exit=None, down_exit=None, on_entrance=None, on_exit=None, items=None)` and put it into the rooms list created in main.py. New items are created using the Item class, which can be extended into things like Inscription and Armor for more functionality
